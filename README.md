| React           | <img height='45' src='https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/1199/posts/30670/preview_image/react.jpg' />             | React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.                                                                                                                                 |
| Webpack         | <img height='50' src='https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2016/07/1-A-_KrEvMuiH7dlwshFw5aw.png' />                       | At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from. |
| Less            | <img height='50' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/LESS_Logo.svg/1200px-LESS_Logo.svg.png'/>    | Less is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets and run on the client side or server side. Designed by Alexis Sellier, Less is influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its CSS-like block formatting syntax.                     |
| Jest            | <img height='50' src='https://nx.dev/documentation/shared/jest-logo.png' />                                                  | Jest is a JavaScript testing framework built on top of Jasmine and maintained by Meta. It was designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications.                                                                                                                          |
| Babel           | <img height='50' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Babel_Logo.svg/1200px-Babel_Logo.svg.png' /> | Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript code that can be run by older JavaScript engines.                                                                                                                               |
| Testing Library | <img height='60' src='https://testing-library.com/img/logo-large.png' />                                                     | The Testing Library family of libraries is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code.            |
